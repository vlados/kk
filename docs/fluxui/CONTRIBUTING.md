## Getting Started

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into two main directories:

- `/components/` - Contains documentation for individual Flux UI components
- `/guides/` - Contains general guides and tutorials

## Writing Guidelines

### Component Documentation

Each component documentation file should follow this structure:

1. **Title** - The name of the component
2. **Description** - A brief description of the component
3. **Basic Usage** - Simple example(s) showing basic usage
4. **Variants** - Different variants of the component (if applicable)
5. **Props** - A table listing all available props
6. **Examples** - More complex examples showing different use cases

### Guides

Guide files should:

1. Use clear and concise language
2. Include code examples where appropriate
3. Use proper Markdown formatting for headers, lists, and code blocks
4. Link to related documentation when relevant

## Formatting

- Use Markdown for all documentation files
- Use backticks for inline code
- Use code fences (```) for code blocks, specifying the language where possible:

```html
<flux:button>Click me</flux:button>
```

- Use tables for structured data like prop references:

```markdown
| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| size | string | 'md' | Size of the component |
```
